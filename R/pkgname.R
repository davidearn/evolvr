#' The \pkg{evolvr} package
#'
#' \pkg{evolvr} is a package for studying evolutionary games in finite
#' populations.
#'
#' This is the version of the `evolvr` package used to make the
#' figures in Molina and Earn (2023).  The latest version of the
#' package is available on github at
#' \url{https://github.com/davidearn/evolvr} and might also be
#' available on CRAN.
#'
#' This version does not have an associated vignette, but we plan to
#' include a vignette is future versions, which should be possible to
#' find via \code{browseVignettes("evolvr")}.
