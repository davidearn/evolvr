#' The \pkg{evolvr} package
#'
#' \pkg{evolvr} is a package for studying evolutionary games in finite
#' populations.
#'
#' This is the version of the `evolvr` package used to make the
#' figures in Molina and Earn (2024, Proc. R. Soc. A, 20230305,
#' \url{https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2023.0305}).  The
#' latest version of the package is available on github at
#' \url{https://github.com/davidearn/evolvr} and might also be
#' available on CRAN.
#'
#' This version does not have an associated vignette, but we plan to
#' include a vignette in future versions, which should be possible to
#' find via \code{browseVignettes("evolvr")}.
